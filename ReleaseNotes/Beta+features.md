Some Mendix platform releases contain beta features. We release these beta features to collect feedback on the implementation, so we can improve on them. We value any feedback on these beta features, as it enables us to provide you with the best possible product.

Availability of beta features will be documented in the release notes for every specific release. Other documentation will be available through the Mendix website. Please consult the release notes and the documentation on how to enable and use these beta features.

Beta features are part of regular Mendix releases. By default they are disabled. Please consult the documentation to learn how to enable and use beta features.

## Testing a Beta Feature

If you would like to test a beta feature, consider the following:

*   Contact the responsible Mendix Product Manager (your Customer Success Manager can introduce you), to assist you in your test project. The Product Manager can help you identify if your use case is a good fit for the particular beta feature.
*   You Customer Success Manager will also ensure involvement of Mendix Expert Services if required, to aid you in your test project, and facilitate you with the required knowledge to successfully make use of the beta feature.
*   Feedback on the quality of the beta feature will be evaluated by the Product Manager.
*   When there is a strong desire to take a beta feature into production, please contact your CSM manager / AE to see if special arrangements are possible

## Limitations

Please take note of the following limitations regarding beta features:

*   Beta features may be incomplete; future releases may include more functionality to complete the feature.
*   Beta features may change in future releases, depending on feedback. Even though we aim for backwards compatibility, Mendix can not guarantee backwards compatibility between monthly releases for beta features.
*   Beta features are not covered by any SLA; we value feedback, including tickets describing problems with beta features, but these tickets will not be handled according to your SLA. We cannot guarantee timely fixes for problems you encounter with beta features.
*   Beta features should not be used for production applications. We do not offer production support on beta features. Beta features may contain bugs, which could potentially lead to data corruption.
