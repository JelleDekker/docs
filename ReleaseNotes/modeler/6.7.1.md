## Fixes

*   We fixed the NullPointerException that occurred when the `'$currentUser'` variable was evaluated in a microflow executed in a non-user session (system session). (Tickets 466900 & 466901)
*   You can now use 6.7.1 for opening 5.21.5 projects (it was not possible to open 5.21.5 projects with 6.7.0). (Ticket 467011)
*   We fixed the conversion issues in the Modeler due to excluded mapping documents.
