### Fixes

*   Fixed issue where an XSD reference in a WSDL section was not deployed correctly. (Ticket 463626)

*   Fixed device type in client for large session data responses (e.g. when there are a lot of entities in the domain model that are visible to the user). (Ticket 464004, 463916)

*   Fixed clicks on the date picker being ignored on Windows Phone. (Ticket 463945)

*   Fixed an issue where conditionally visible widgets could cause flickering of the page, a changing scroll position, or the scrollbar sometimes not appearing. (Ticket 463592)

*   Fixed memory leak in the data view which caused a noticeable slowdown and could even crash the browser. (Ticket 464612)
